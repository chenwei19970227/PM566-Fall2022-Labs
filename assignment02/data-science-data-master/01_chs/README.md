> The Children's Health Study (CHS) is one of the largest and most detailed studies of the long-term effects of air pollution on the respiratory health of children. More than 12,000 school children living in southern California are involved in this ongoing study. Data on their health, exposure to air pollution, and factors that affected their responses to air pollution were gathered annually from elementary through senior high school. Findings from these studies have led to changes in state and federal guidelines to improve air quality standards and urban planning decisions and better protect and improve everyoneâ€™s health.
